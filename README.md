# [ THEME NAME ]

[ SHORT THEME DESCRIPTION ]

This theme is made with love and brought to you by the folks of [WP Munich](http://www.wp-munich.de) and [Luehrsen // Heinrich](http://www.luehrsen-heinrich.de)

## Paradigms

### Mobile First
Designs and styles should be made first for the mobile version. This ensures a seamless experience for the majority of mobile users. [Learn more](https://en.ryte.com/wiki/Mobile_First)

### CSS Grid First
Contrasting our grid-system-history, this theme should not rely on a traditional grid-system like in [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/). While such a 12-col grid is still useful in designing the theme and giving it structure, the resulting CSS code should be declarative and based on [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/).

### Alignfull First
This theme will be primarily build for the new block based editor in WordPress. This means, that the 'normal' state of the content is always the alignfull and smaller states should be restricted in width by a `max-width` setting.

### Compatibility
With a huge blocks ecosystem on the horizon new themes should be compatible with a wide variety of blocks. This means that content styling has to be as abstract as possible and provide a well defined scaffolding to put content into. The goal is less, more elegant code.

### No pixels
Using pixel values on the web makes sense. [Until it doesn't](https://engageinteractive.co.uk/blog/em-vs-rem-vs-px). Using `rem` and `em` values is more accessible and reliable. So using a `px` value to determine the size of something should be the absolute exception and very well justified.
